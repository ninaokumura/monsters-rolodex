# Monsters Rolodex

This is a single page application built using React and it displays a list of different monsters and their info. You can also use the search bar to look for them.

Monsters Rolodex was the first project in the "Complete React Developer" course by Andrei Neagoie.

The main goal while building this simple single page application was to learn the main concepts of React:

- NPM vs. NPX
- Introduction to JSX
- Rendering Elements
- Components and props
- State and lifecycle
- Handling events
